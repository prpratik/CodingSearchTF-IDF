TF-IDF Based Search Engine
Overview
This project implements a robust search engine designed to extract, preprocess, and rank text-based data using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) calculations. The application is built using Python, with a Flask backend and a responsive HTML/CSS frontend, deployed using Render and Gunicorn to ensure scalability and reliability. It automates data extraction via Selenium and WebDriverManager, efficiently processes the data, and enhances query relevance with an inverted index.

Features
TF-IDF Ranking Algorithm: Calculates the relevance of documents to a given search query using advanced TF-IDF scoring.
Automated Data Extraction: Utilizes Selenium and WebDriverManager for dynamic and large-scale web scraping.
Inverted Index Implementation: Enhances query efficiency and retrieval speed by indexing document terms.
Scalable Deployment: Deployed on Render with Gunicorn, ensuring production-grade scalability and reliability.
Responsive Frontend: User-friendly search interface built with HTML and CSS, providing a seamless user experience.
